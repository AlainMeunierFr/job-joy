Own the full product lifecycle—from strategic discovery and selection to sales enablement and adoption
Be responsible for "productizing" third-party technology solutions, ensuring that partner capabilities are transformed into seamless, market-ready internal products.
Ensure the partner-backed portfolio is commercially viable, compliant, and scalable, offering measurable business value
Conduct regular sessions with business and sales stakeholders to understand their strategic goals and translate those requirements into clear partner criteria
Develop and maintain a prioritised product roadmap for partner solutions, outlining key initiatives, timelines, and value drivers
Collaborate with partners and internal marketing teams to ensure high-quality product documentation, demos, and sales collateral are available
Manage day-to-day partner relationships and negotiate contracts to ensure optimal value and service delivery.
Enforce governance for the entire partner ecosystem, ensuring all products meet strict security, compliance, and scalability standards. (GDPR, PCI, HIPAA, etc.)

Degree in Business Administration, Technology Management, or a related field
5+ years of progressive experience in product management, with a focus on digital products and technologies
Proven track record of successfully "productizing" third-party SaaS/PaaS solutions (buying and integrating tech rather than just building it)
Experience working closely with sales teams, creating enablement materials, and driving commercial adoption of technical products
Extensive experience bridging the gap between technical teams and commercial stakeholders
Broad understanding of current and emerging digital technologies in customer care environments (e.g. cloud computing, Conversational AI, Social Media Management, Case management, Generative AI, and CRM platforms)
Understanding of agile development methodologies and product lifecycle management
English verbal and written is required (C1 or higher level).
It is beneficial to have at least one or more European languages (B2 or higher) such as Spanish, German, Italian
